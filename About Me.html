               <h1>Why Did I Start this Company?</h1>
                 
               <p> My inspiration to start a business stemmed from a burning desire to work for myself, and a lifelong passion for the NBA and its players. I felt that genuine inspiration, principles, and empowerment were lacking in the NBA jersey industry. Thus, I created this website. My mission is to ignite inspiration in people, empowering them to push past limits and  fight fearlessly.
              </p>
               <h1> What are the Goals for my Company?</h1>
               <p> With this company, I want to make a whole bunch of money. No joke. I like the NBA, and people will spend fortunes on jerseys. Easy life decision. Easy cash.</p>
               <h1> Why is this better than the offical NBA store?</h1>
               <p> Here, we have much better deals. Men's jerseys are only 50 bucks, children's are 30 bucks. Also, it's a solo owned company. Help a brother out.</p>
               <h1> Who's better, Jordan or Lebron?</h1>
               <p> Jordan, easily. Lebron is top 5 though.</p>
               <h1> Who are my top 5 favorite players of all time?</h1>
               <p> 1. Steph Curry, 2. Dwyane Wade, 3. John Wall, 4. Shaq, 5. Kobe</p>
               <h1> Are the Warriors ruining the league?</h1>
               <p> No, stop hating. They're champs, fair and square.</p>
               <h1> Was Ben Simmons a rookie last year?</h1>
               <p> Yes, but Donovan Mitchell still deserved ROY.</p>
               <h1> What are my favorite football and baseball teams?</h1>
               <p> This is a basketball website...but Niners and A's.</p>
